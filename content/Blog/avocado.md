# Would you pay $0.38 to ripen your avocado?

Of course you would, and here's how to make it happen.

The typical story of any millennials life is that they go to Trader Joe's [Whole Foods, Piggly Wiggly] with the intention of making delicious toast. Inevitably, they find rock hard avocados that resemble bowling balls instead of tender ripe fruit.

Not to worry, pick up those rocks (avocados) and 2 bananas - which cost $0.38 at Trader Joe's. Simply place the ripe bananas in a paper bag with the avocados and the ethylene that they emit will ripen your rock in about a day.
