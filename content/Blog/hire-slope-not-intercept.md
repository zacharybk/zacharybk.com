The reason why I am where I am today is because two people at DigitalOcean (Moisey Uretsky & John Edgar) took a shot at hiring me. They approached it as an experiment, had massive doses of a growth mindset, and extended that good will to me. 

It all worked out fantastically, so I wonder why more companies and hiring managers only hire for "someone who's been there and done that" rather than hiring for someone's future ability to be amazing? This is called hiring for slope over intercept: "If y-intercept is what you start with, then slope is how quickly you adapt, learn, and the effort you put in." ([source](https://matt-rickard.com/hire-slope-not-intercept) - It's worth a read!)
