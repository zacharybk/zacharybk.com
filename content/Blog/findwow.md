# Find wow!

In the past week I had two experiences that gave me chills. One way at a free exhibit and another at a Broadway show. 

The African photos shown at the exhibit were truly exceptional, and entirely unlike anything else that I have ever seen. I was amazed that there was such a variety of things that I had never seen a parallel to in my life. 

The broadway show called Jagged Little Pill, based off the Alanis Morissette album was incredible. It was the first time that I had been part of or witnessed a roaring standing ovation at a Broadway show. You would have thought that U2 was performing. 

Our typical day is full of distractions, yet I have found that stillness to find wow in everyday life. Put away your phone to find it. Look at everyday circumstances in a new way, like the work of a great teammate or the love of your partner.
